I am a Senior Product Manager at Oracle, where I lead the development of AI and ML-powered products designed to help Financial Institutions prevent and detect financial crime, making our financial system safer and more secure.

I am a data scientist turned product manager and an infinite learner constantly seeking to become a little wiser every single day.
